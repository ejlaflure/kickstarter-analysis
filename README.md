- The visulation above shows very clearly an inverse relation of successful kickstarter campaigns vs failed kickstarter campaigns as the price point of the goal increases. This analysis was spacifically done for plays and illustrates if the goal is <$15,000 there is a higher prercent chance that the kickstarter will be successful. For kick starters that range from $35,000-$50,000 the data also shows a higher prercent chance that the kickstarter will be successful, but the amount of campaigns in this range are very low so this data is not concultive and should not be considered at this time. 
- Based on this data I would recommend to set the kickstarter goal below $5,000 giving your kickstarter a 72-75% chance of success.
- Also to consider, kickstarter campaigns that start in the months of May and June are far more lickly to be successful vs starting in other months in the year. Below is a visulization that clearly demostrates this by analysing thearter kickstarters in particular.
